This repo contains all the files for the Task Manager application built by me in react native
, using react-native-cli.
To build the project on your system, please use react native cli and not expo as expo will throw dependency errors and the project will not build. 
On downloadng the zip file and extracting all the files, or cloning the repo directly, first run npm install once in the file directory. Then the app can be built and run just like any other react native cli app.
